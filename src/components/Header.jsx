import React from 'react';

const Header = () => {
    return (
<div className="App-header">

<p>
This is a demo app.  You set a timer, and if the timer runs out it texts somebody with your location.  
Unfortunately the location doesn't work, and this is done in React, not React Native.  
Still some way to go yet...

</div>

       
    );
};

export default Header;
